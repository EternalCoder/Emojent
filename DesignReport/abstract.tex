Everyday there are thousands of people who struggle with social issues and related anxieties. One major aspect of this issue stems from many people's inability to easily recognize another person's emotions. Struggling with reading other people's facial expressions can lead to severe social anxiety and problems connecting with others. In this document we are propose a mobile application that uses computer vision libraries and a pre-existing emotion recognition API to process live video and display a filter that gives the user an estimation of another person's emotional state, based on their facial expression. Currently we are in the design phase, putting the finishing touches on our design and getting ready to move into implementation.
